            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>Hi hi! I'm Terri, and I currently live in Washington State in a small town by Deception Pass. I've lived here for 19 years ever since moving from Japan. Ever since I was little, I've had an strong love for dogs, especially the herding breed. I am currently a dog mother of 2 Australian Shepherds!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am a graduate from Washington State University with a degree in Zoology. Since childhood, I've had an interest in the medical field. The entirety of my family and many of my close friends have all been or are currently in the medical field. The idea of helping others and leaving a positive impact has always been a priority of mine. During the time of the pandemic, I had time to sit down and look at articles and just overall, use the internet more than I would normally. This experience made me realize,not only medical professionals with direct patient care can help others. </p>
            <br>
            <p>While working at a clinic, I directly worked with hospital portal systems and health insurance websites. Many of these systems were very difficult for me to understand and overwhelmed many of my patients. Creating a website that is both easy to understand and functional with both computers/mobile devices are critically important for the community.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My goal with coding is to <br>1. learn a new skill <br>2. Obtain a better understanding of how websites are formed <br>3. Be able to use the knowledge obtained in the medical field</p>
